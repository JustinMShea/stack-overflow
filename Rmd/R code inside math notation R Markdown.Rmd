## [Question Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45360684/r-code-inside-math-notation-r-markdown/45361147#45361147)

In R Markdown, I can get an inline r code chunk to run inside single $ math notation (only with a * before), but not double $$ math notation:

* $H_o = `r 1 + 1`$

works, but:

$H_o = `r 1 + 1`$

doesn't work, and neither does:

$$H_o = `r 1 + 1`$$

The double `$$` is more flexible being able to put math notation on multiple lines, but how can you add inline code chunks inside?


## Answer

I ran your example and it worked fine for me!


$$H_o = `r 1 + 1`$$

Perhaps you should check your version of rmarkdown and knitr. I have noticed over the years that version updates, and sometimes even using the most recent dev version, can fix a litany of small issues that arise.

Using R 3.4.1, here are my `knitr` and `rmarkdown` versions:

```{r}
citation()

citation("knitr")

citation("rmarkdown")
````
