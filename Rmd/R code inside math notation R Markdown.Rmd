## Question

In R Markdown, I can get an inline r code chunk to run inside single $ math notation (only with a * before), but not double $$ math notation:

* $H_o = `r 1 + 1`$

works, but:

$H_o = `r 1 + 1`$

doesn't work, and neither does:

$$H_o = `r 1 + 1`$$

The double `$$` is more flexible being able to put math notation on multiple lines, but how can you add inline code chunks inside?


## Answer

It appears to work just fine for me!


$$H_o = `r 1 + 1`$$
Using R 3.4.1, here are my `knitr` and `rmarkdown` versions:

```{r}
citation("knitr")

citation("rmarkdown")
